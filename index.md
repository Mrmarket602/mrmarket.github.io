# Mr. Market
The world's first Finanical SOcial Network App 

# Project story 

Imagine working your entire life and ending up with such little savings that you are unable to survive. Where is the financial independence here?

Do you want to work for the rest of your life to save money or do you want your money (savings) to work for you? I believe the second choice is preferable!

I'm Jayraj, and I come from a middle-class household where my parents put their money into education and a house, and now, at the age of 58, they don't have enough money to just enjoy their lives. Don't be concerned! I'll take care of them, but this is the real-life example I've seen. I was also able to observe similar examples within my friends, family, and surroundings.

When I was going in my father's auto and passing by skyscrapers and luxurious cars, I was always curious as to how these people were so wealthy and how they made money. It was always, believe me! If schools could teach me about financial literacy, I believe this question would not arise.

When I came to Poland and began studying, I received my answer. It takes a long time to understand various financial terms and topics. Imagine being a backer who is suddenly required to learn coding. To better understand the process, I began reading a books and taking trading courses. I realized that if it takes so much time for me, how can I expect it to work for others? Specially for the middle class and poor people! 

I've received answers to all of my childhood questions, such as why the rich become richer and the poor get poorer. What is the best way to become wealthy? What is the best way to achieve financial independence? Why we should know about the taxes?  What are the steps to being financially independent? Significant difference between investing and saving.
Aren't you asking yourself such questions?

## Where did the project come from? 
I was reading a book called Intelligent Investor when the concept of Mr. Market first came to mind. It was my first step in thinking about and acting on mobile applications.
Personally, I believe I have a strong sense of empathy because I come from a low-income family and understand how middle-class people think. How do we get stuck in the same cycle, unable to locate the existential, and complaining our entire lives?

Our beliefs, mindsets, and habits are the basis of everything we do. I'm not trying to teach people how to invest; instead, I'm trying to convince them why they should. What is the best way to achieve financial independence? People will be able to find a way to become financially independent if they have clear mindsets and an understanding of investment, and this starts with our surroundings and habits. If your child is surrounded by nice people, he or she will be a good child who will learn good values from them, just like you did. If you surround yourself with individuals who have the same mindset as you and talk about money, profit, and interest, you will naturally begin to think about it and begin to act on it.

## How am I going to do? 
There are only 6 simple ways to improve your financial literacy which I will introduce in the mobile app:
•	Read financial newsletters
•	Listen to financial podcasts
•	Read personal finance books
•	Use Social Media
•	Start keeping a budget
•	Talk to a financial professional 

I have vision to add all those basic elements into the App and provide it to user free of costs. Yes, there will be no subscription for those basic elements. Imagine having all financial gears at one place which can help to make financial decision. 

## Where I am now on the project stage? 
I've already covered social networking, financial news, and notes, as well as some fundamental mobile app features. However, I require support in order to make our hotel wonderful and perfect. I require financial support. I am now investing my personal funds. I began this project on June 15, 2020, with no prior expertise of mobile applications or project management, and I am already at the basic Skelton model level (Beta testing on playstore). 
I've come so far with only $4000, so if I get some help, I'll be able to take this app to the next level, where everyone can benefit. 
Good technology and smart people are required for a good product. Savvy people are smart enough to demand a fair price for their knowledge, which I'd like to use and put into practice.

## Why Mr. Market? 
Everyone nowadays, from a taxi driver to a doctor, knows how to use social media, so why not use it for learning and developing strong mindsets?

Perhaps one question will come in your mind: there are already Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms, and they all have finance groups and pages, so why Mr. Market?
•	Yes, I agree, but where would you go if you want to eat local food from your city? To that local store that specializes in that meal or to restaurants that don't specialize in any one food and provide a variety of food?
•	Secondly, have you ever gone on social media to look for something specific and found yourself in a completely new place? I believe that has always happened since social media covers a wide range of topics.
